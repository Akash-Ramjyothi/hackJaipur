## Track and Problem Statement üöß

We are integrating three tracks with our project, namely:

- **Tech and Health**: Technology can create sustainable and effective relations between a healthcare professional and the patient. It can also provide a cheaper, faster, and more beneficial solutions to prevent and battle illnesses.
- **Diversity**: Diversity means the inclusion of all individuals as technology does not discriminate.
- **Creating Awareness**: With the increase in the use of technology, the dangers have also increased. Awareness is the first step towards creating a better society and community. Awareness can be social, technical, or general.
  - **Problem Statement**: Mental Health Assessment and Aid

## Background üìñ

A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that 7.5 per cent of the Indian population suffers from some form of mental disorder. Mental illnesses constitute one-sixth of all health-related disorders and India accounted for nearly 15% of the global mental, neurological and substance abuse disorder burden. The treatment gap, which is defined as the prevalence of mental illnesses and the proportion of patients that get treatment, is over 70 per cent. WHO also predicts that by 2020, roughly 20 per cent of India will suffer from mental illnesses. And to cater to this demographic, we have less than 4,000 mental health professionals.

In our country, the discovery of a mental illness is often followed by denial and hesitation to seek help. Despite its enormous social burden, mental health remains a taboo subject that is susceptible to age-old stigmas, prejudices and fears. Even though mental disorders can be cured or controlled, most people tend to sweep their issues under the carpet and suffer in silence. Not only do we need to actively foster awareness about mental health, we also need to create awareness about the absurdity of the stigmas attached to mental health, in order to eradicate them.

**Be Kind to your Mind**
